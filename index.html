<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator have proven
to be a powerful tool for digital geometry processing, providing a description
of geometry that is essentially independent of coordinates or the choice of
discretization. However, since Laplace-Beltrami is purely intrinsic it
struggles to capture important phenomena such as extrinsic bending, sharp
edges, and fine surface texture. We introduce a new extrinsic differential
operator called the <em>relative Dirac operator</em>, leading to a family of operators
with a continuous trade-off between intrinsic and extrinsic features. Previous
operators are either fully or partially intrinsic. In contrast, the proposed
family spans the entire spectrum: from completely intrinsic (depending only on
the metric) to completely extrinsic (depending only on the Gauss map). By
adding an infinite potential well to this (or any) operator we can also
robustly handle surface patches with irregular boundary. We explore use of
these operators for a variety of shape analysis tasks, and study their
performance relative to operators previously found in the geometry processing
literature.</p>
